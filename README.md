# validate
ColdFusion Server Side Form Validation Component

This validation works in parallel with the JavaScript and jQuery validation tool created by Benjamin Keen.

jQuery plugin

Standalone Javascript
http://www.benjaminkeen.com/open-source-projects/smaller-projects/really-simple-validation-js/really-simple-validation-standalone-version/

With this component you merely copy the rules that you have set up in your javascript RSV rules [] and paste them into the ColdFusion server side location where the form is submitted.
